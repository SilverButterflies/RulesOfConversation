Are you a robot trying to understand its creators? Are you an alien trying to study humans? Then you have come to the right place. Here you will find the rules of conversation that govern (most) human communication. Remember these rules and apply them well, and too can blend into the humans as one of them. A word of warning however, it is mentally taxing to maintain this appearance, so make sure not to keep it up all of the time. And with that, I shall introduce you to Grice and his Cooperative Principle.

Grice writes in his book Logic and Conversation (1975) of the Cooperative Principle, "Make your contribution such as is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged". 

Fair enough, but this is too vague to be useful on its own, so we will get into the details. Grice introduced the concept of "conversational implicatures". Essentially, the act of saying something does not only communicate the meaning of each word. The manner in which a person has chosen to say something, the time and place, the person they are talking to, etc. also communicate information. Even the fact that a person chose to say anything at all (as opposed to _not_ saying a thing) communicates information to the listener (called the interlocutor), and anyone else observing the exchange. The reason that this 'secret information' is communicated is that there are assumptions ('assumptions of rationality') shared by the interlocutors about each other. These are:
1. Your interlocutor is a rational thinking being, just like you. This means that they choose to talk (or choose not to) in a particular way because they have some goal in mind.
2. Your interlocutor assumes the same about you, ad infinitum.

So now the question is, what is this goal? Interlocutors may share a goal, such as transferring information from one interlocutor to another, or even to simply make pleasant conversation. It is possible that the interlocutors do not share a goal, such as in a debate. An interlocutor may communicate their goals, or they may choose to hide them (almost always for malicious reasons). Before we consider how you can communicate your goal to the interlocutor as well as understanding theirs, we will get back to Grice's Cooperative Principle.

The cooperative principle essentially states that unless there is very obvious evidence to the contrary, humans assume that they are cooperating with their interlocutor to achieve a shared goal. In service of this goal, there are four "maxims" that are known (usually implicitly) by all humans. Now it is easy to assume that these maxims are unbreakable rules that must always be followed. However, this is incorrect, as humans violate these maxims all the time. And because all humans know these maxims, and they assume their interlocutor knows these maxims, this can be used to communicate secret information. 

The four maxims are:
1. Quantity: Say only how much you need to say, not more not less.
3. Quality: Be truthful (mostly).
4. Relation: Connect your thought to the thought that came before.
5. Manner: Speak in a way that you will be understood by your interlocutor.

Looking at this list, they look like universal rules if you want to be understood. In fact, if you, dear reader, vow to never violate a maxim to the best of your ability, you will likely still be understood by humans, though they may think you speak funny. However, you cannot control the fact that humans violate these maxims in oftentimes confusing ways, so you must keep a look out for them. 
There are four ways to violate a maxim:
1. Quietly: This is known as 'lying by omission'.
2. Opt-out: your interlocutor might apologise for not being allowed to say more.

  >A: Sorry, my lips are sealed.
  
3. Clash: There is no way to fulfill one maxim without violating another. For example if your interlocutor does not know something, they cannot fulfil the maxim of Quantity without violating the maxim of Quality.
  
  >A: Where is that book you borrowed?
  
  >B: It is here somewhere.
  
  This exchange violates the maxim of Quantity, because B is not specific enough. A assumes that B is doing his best to follow the maxims. By this assumption, if B tried to follow this maxim, he would break another maxim, such as below.
  
  >A: Where is that book you borrowed?
  
  >B: I gave it back to you this morning.
  
  In this case, B is lying, thus breaking the maxim of Quality. Thus, A concludes that B does not know where the book is, and has given the information he has, so they can start looking for it. 

4. Flouting: The interlocutor blatantly violates a maxim for no aparent reason.

The last case seems bizarre to the uninitiated. The reasoning is that if the interlocutor is violating a maxim but not making any effort to hide it, then they must want you to see it, by the assumption that they are a rational being. Then, as they are assumed to know you are a rational being too, you can infer _why_ they are violating said maxim, without them having to _tell_ you explicitly. Thus, flouting a maxim can be used to communicate secret information between interlocutors.

Each maxim has many sub-maxims, and each sub-maxim can be violated in many ways. To see excellent examples of each, it is best to read Logic and Conversation by H.P. Grice. However, when you are walking among the humans, it is much more useful to learn how to apply the above information to tap into the secret information. 

## Words that have no intrinsic meaning
What does "Hello" mean? It is not a noun or a verb or an adjective, and yet pretty much every language has a word for it. It is the same with "Bye", "Please", "Thank you", and many others. These words are special because they can _only_ communicate secret information. Furthermore, as many of us are not aware of this secret information, it is a frequent mistake to simply stop using them. So-called 'small talk' such as talking about the weather or the weekend is in the same general category. The purpose of these elements is not to communicate information directly, but rather to establish the goals of the interlocutors. This is because the inherent lack of direct information communicates to the participants of the small talk, that their interlocutor is interested in investing time to build a connection with them. Otherwise why would they waste their time communicating nothing at all? This again goes back to the initial assumptions of rationality. Keeping this in mind, here are a few rules relating to these types of words:

**Hello:** This word and others in its family (e.g. hi, good __, hey) are used to acknowledge a person and establish that you have begun paying attention to them, and to ask them to do likewise. This is similar to a computer sending a 'handshake' message to another computer to say it wishes to start a conversation (send/recieve data), and to ask that the interlocutor (really a server) dedicate some space in its RAM to listen to the computer. In humans, these words are used as soon as you see a person/people, even if you are not planning to speak to them immediately, because it is possible that they might want to speak to you and you are showing you are paying (some) attention in case they start a conversation. Failing to do this even when you recognise a person you know is considered disrespectful, because it signals that you do not care if they start speaking to you, and therefore wish to not pay attention to them. There is naturally a chance that a person recognises you and says hello, and you miss this because your attention is otherwise occupied. If the human notices this, it is likely they will forgive the accidental indescretion and not think anything of it. This also applies to the humans you interact with, where they will say hello to you for the same reasons. In this case, you it is top priority to immediately reply with a smile and a hello to the best of your ability. This trumps almost all other rules (e.g. do not speak while eating). If someone deliberately chooses not to say hello to you even when they have recognised you, then it indicates they do not care about you. This may be because they do not know you well enough, or because they do not like you. Assume the former unless overwhelming evidence for the latter. 

**Please:** This word is used during a request, for communicating that you assume the assumption of rationality, and recognise that your interlocutor has their own goals that do not necessarily align exactly with yours. Additionally, you communicate that they may potentially have to deviate from their goals and inconvenience themselves to further _your_ goals by completeing your request. Finally, the inclusion of the word please also indicates that your interlocutor has to option to deny the request, because you recognise that your goals are not superior to their own. This way, you can use the word please to get people to do things for you without undermining their rationality, freedom, and respect. The word is often used in conjunction with phrasing the request as a question, such as "can you please __ ?" or "can you __ please?". The __ is where the request is. An important note is that it is best to use this word (sometimes even more so) when your interlocutor is _not_ free to deny your request (such as if you are their boss or teacher etc.), or if the request does _not_ benifit your goals but _theirs_. This is because humans like to feel like their rationality, freedom, and respect are not being undermined, even when that is an illusion. Thus, humans are more likely to aquiesce to your request (or a command phrased as a request) if you phrase it this way. Humans who make requests of you do so for similar reasons. Finally, if a human does not say please while making a request, they may be deliberately trying to intimidate you into agreeing (they are not nice) or they may have simply forgotten (everyone makes mistakes once in a while). For very trivial requests (e.g. pass the salt), it is possible that a slight smile and a polite tone of voice are enough without phrasing or inclusion of "please". This is hard to achieve, and is it recommended to use "can you please __?" whenever making a request.

**Bye:** This word and others in its family (e.g. goodbye, have a great __ , see you soon) are used to close what a hello started. They indicate that you are no longer paying attention to the interlocutor for in case they start talking to you. It is important to note that this is not necessarily said as soon as you and your interlocutor stop speaking, but rather when you _cannot_ continue speaking if you wanted to, such as if one of you is leaving the earshot of the other. 

# A special note on greetings
Greetings ("Hello" and "Bye") are important rituals that have some of their own special rules. The overarching goal is to exhibit joy at seeing the human that is greeted. This makes the human feel valued. The process of executing a greeting is detailed below. 

1. Decide what kind of greeting you wish to use. Do this based on how close you are at this moment, distance wise. If you are within around 2m, use a verbal greeting. If you are further, it is better to wave.
2. Make eye contact with the human and smile. Do not change your expression or look away for the duration of the greeting. 
3. Make the greeting (verbal or waving).
4. Resume default face.

These steps apply for both when you wish to greet a human, and also when a human greets you first. It is important to say the greeting loudly enough that the human can hear you, but does not feel like you are not screaming at them. Thus, the optimal volume is dependent on your mutual distance, any background noise, whether the human is distracted, and any prior knowledge you may have about their unusually good or poor hearing. When waving, hold out your palm facing the human. Hold it at (your) chest height or heigher. Ensure that it does not obstruct your view of them at any point during the greeting. Keep your hand loose, with fingers neither rigidly touching, nor splayed fully apart. Next, rotate your hand mostly at the wrist, and very slightly at the elbow, and go left and right. The maximum amplitude of the motion should be around a palm-width on either side. Roughly 1.5 of the period of the motion should be completed in the duration it takes you to say the word "hello". The amplitude, frequency, and duration of the motion may be lengthened slightly to show enthusiasm. 

## Non-verbal communication
Humans communicate secret information from their body language. Frustratingly, this is frequently in contrast to their actual words. Including a guide to decoding this body language is difficult using just text, but I might add it here later. Look up tutorials for actors in plays if that helps. For now, I am assuming that you have already decoded the human's body language (it is quite similar to that of other mammals such as cats, though most humans do not hiss when angry). The key when dealing with a human's feelings is to remember the aforementioned assumptions. While it is easy to pet a cat to get her to calm down, it is much more complicated with a human. Firstly, it is dependent on your relationship with said human. Additionally, it is dependent on how much physical contact they prefer. How do you find this out? I have absolutely no idea...Ask them? idk

## Eye contact
Humans use their eyes to collect visual information about their surroundings, and their interlocutor. Humans assume that their interlocutor uses their eyes for similar reasons, and makes a similar assumption about them, ad infinitum ('assumptions of eyes'). This is similar to the assumptions of rationality. The key difference is that while there are no known humans who are not rational beings, there do exist visually impaired humans, for whom these assumptions, and therefore the rules that follow, may not apply. A corollary of the assumptions of eyes is that looking at someones eyes allows you to find how interested they are in you. Thus, if you see that your interlocutor is looking at you more, then it indicates that they are more likely to be more interested in you and the conversation. This explains the reason why humans have the need to maintain an "appropriate" amount of eye contact. This correlates to an indication of the "appropriate" level of interest in the interlocutor. It is natural that your interlocutor wishes to feel like them and their words are important to you, while also not feeling overly scrutinised. 

There are a few simple guidelines for maintaining this 'appropriate' level of eye contact. {Sidenote: if you have evolved to flee from eyes, as some bird species here on earth, it may be easier to look at the tip of the human's nose, and then each eyebrow} 

- Maintain eye contact for the entire duration of saying a word with no intrinsic meaning.
- Make brief eye contact after each sentence when you are speaking. Do not sustain it for more than 5 seconds. 
- Make eye contact after every implied comma (,) when your interlocutor is speaking. Do not sustain it for more than 3 seconds without demonstrating your attention. Do not sustain eye contact for more than 10 seconds. 

## Demonstrating your attention
When your interlocutor is speaking, it is important to acknowledge that you are paying attention. This indicates that you value your interlocutor and their words, which makes them think better of you in turn. The way to acknowledge that you are listening is to nod slightly, and/or say "mhm" with a rising tone, after every implied comma.  
Ik theres more things I can say here, but idk what.. Am I secretly bad at this? I should practice my listening skills it seems. 

## More on the Maxim of Quality (sometimes being useful is better than telling the truth)
"Honesty is the best policy." All children learn this rule from a young age. Humans however, seem to outgrow this rule. It seems that sometimes, the Maxim of Quality is best followed by deliberately _lying_. The more proper rules are:
- If the truth is positive, tell the truth.
    > A: You have really pretty eyes.

- If the truth is negative, but easily fixable, tell the truth (gently).
    > B: Hey, I think you have something stuck in your teeth.

- If the truth is negative, but they need to know it for some reason, tell them the truth.
    > C: Hey... Im sorry to break this to you... but your grade on the test was below passing.

- If the truth is negative, but not immediately relevant or fixable, dont tell them.
   > D: I think you are ugly
   Dont say that.

## Asking questions
I have no idea how to ask lots of questions without seeming rude and argumentative :(
Like maybe phrase it as a request for information? like "can you please tell me __?" rather than "why?... yes but why??..ok, when and also how???" 

## Comforting people when they are sad
Like... depends on how much they would be comfortable with you touching them?? Max it out. They let you hold their hand, so that. They let you hold them in your arms? Perfect. Also it doesnt matter what you say, as long as you dont interrupt when they are talking, and you say it really quietly and with a rising tone at the end and stretching the last syllable. Bonus points if you end every statement of fact with a "...yea?" like its a question. Honestly idk Im really bad at this :(

## Default face
How should you arrange your face to look politely interested when you are making pleasant conversation? I HAVE NO IDEA :(
Like idk slight smile? dont think about your eyebrows!
