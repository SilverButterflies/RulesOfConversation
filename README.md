Are you a robot wanting to understand its creators? Are you an alien conducting a study on humans? Then you have come to the right place. Here you will find the rules of conversation that govern (most) human communication. Remember these rules, and apply them well, and you too can blend in among the humans as one of them. A word of warning however, it is mentally taxing to maintain this appearance, so make sure not to keep it up all of the time. And with that, I shall introduce you to Grice and his Cooperative Principle.

Grice writes in his book Logic and Conversation (1975) of the Cooperative Principle, "Make your contribution such as is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged". 

Fair enough, but this is too vague to be useful on its own, so we will get into the details. Grice introduced the concept of "conversational implicatures". Essentially, the act of saying something does not only communicate the meaning of each word. The manner in which a person has chosen to say something, the time and place, the person they are talking to, etc. also communicate information. Even the fact that a person chose to say anything at all (as opposed to _not_ saying a thing) communicates information to the listener (called the interlocutor), and anyone else observing the exchange. The reason that this 'secret information' is communicated is that there are assumptions ('assumptions of rationality') shared by the interlocutors about each other. These are:
1. Your interlocutor is a rational thinking being, just like you. This means that they choose to talk (or choose not to) in a particular way because they have some goal in mind.
2. Your interlocutor assumes the same about you, ad infinitum.

So now the question is, what is this goal? Interlocutors may share a goal, such as transferring information from one interlocutor to another, or even to simply make pleasant conversation. It is possible that the interlocutors do not share a goal, such as in a debate. An interlocutor may communicate their goals, or they may choose to hide them (almost always for malicious reasons). Before we consider how you can communicate your goal to the interlocutor as well as understanding theirs, we will get back to Grice's Cooperative Principle.

The cooperative principle essentially states that unless there is very obvious evidence to the contrary, humans assume that they are cooperating with their interlocutor to achieve a shared goal. In service of this goal, there are four "maxims" that are known (usually implicitly) by all humans. Now it is easy to assume that these maxims are unbreakable rules that must always be followed. However, this is incorrect, as humans violate these maxims all the time. And because all humans know these maxims, and they assume their interlocutor knows these maxims, this can be used to communicate secret information. 

The four maxims are:
1. Quantity: Say only how much you need to say, not more not less.
3. Quality: Be truthful (mostly).
4. Relation: Connect your thought to the thought that came before.
5. Manner: Speak in a way that you will be understood by your interlocutor.

Looking at this list, they look like universal rules if you want to be understood. In fact, if you, dear reader, vow to never violate a maxim to the best of your ability, you will likely still be understood by humans, though they may think you speak funny. However, you cannot control the fact that humans violate these maxims in oftentimes confusing ways, so you must keep a look out for them. 
There are four ways to violate a maxim:
1. Quietly: This is known as 'lying by omission'.
2. Opt-out: your interlocutor might apologise for not being allowed to say more.

  >A: Sorry, my lips are sealed.
  
3. Clash: There is no way to fulfill one maxim without violating another. For example if your interlocutor does not know something, they cannot fulfil the maxim of Quantity without violating the maxim of Quality.
  
  >A: Where is that book you borrowed?
  
  >B: It is here somewhere.
  
  This exchange violates the maxim of Quantity, because B is not specific enough. A assumes that B is doing his best to follow the maxims. By this assumption, if B tried to follow this maxim, he would break another maxim, such as below.
  
  >A: Where is that book you borrowed?
  
  >B: I gave it back to you this morning.
  
  In this case, B is lying, thus breaking the maxim of Quality. Thus, A concludes that B does not know where the book is, and has given the information he has, so they can start looking for it. 

4. Flouting: The interlocutor blatantly violates a maxim for no aparent reason.

The last case seems bizarre to the uninitiated. The reasoning is that if the interlocutor is violating a maxim but not making any effort to hide it, then they must want you to see it, by the assumption that they are a rational being. Then, as they are assumed to know you are a rational being too, you can infer _why_ they are violating said maxim, without them having to _tell_ you explicitly. Thus, flouting a maxim can be used to communicate secret information between interlocutors.

Each maxim has many sub-maxims, and each sub-maxim can be violated in many ways. To see excellent examples of each, it is best to read Logic and Conversation by H.P. Grice. However, when you are walking among the humans, it is much more useful to learn how to apply the above information to tap into the secret information. 

## Words that have no intrinsic meaning
What does "Hello" mean? It is not a noun or a verb or an adjective, and yet pretty much every language has a word for it. It is the same with "Bye", "Please", "Thank you", and many others. These words are special because they can _only_ communicate secret information. Furthermore, as many of us are not aware of this secret information, it is a frequent mistake to simply stop using them. So-called 'small talk' such as talking about the weather or the weekend is in the same general category. The purpose of these elements is not to communicate information directly, but rather to establish the goals of the interlocutors. This is because the inherent lack of direct information communicates to the participants of the small talk, that their interlocutor is interested in investing time to build a connection with them. Otherwise why would they waste their time communicating nothing at all? This again goes back to the initial assumptions of rationality. Keeping this in mind, here are a few rules relating to these types of words:

**Hello:** This word and others in its family (e.g. hi, good __, hey) are used to acknowledge a person and establish that you have begun paying attention to them, and to ask them to do likewise. This is similar to a computer sending a 'handshake' message to another computer to say it wishes to start a conversation (send/recieve data), and to ask that the interlocutor (really a server) dedicate some space in its RAM to listen to the computer. In humans, these words are used as soon as you see a person/people, even if you are not planning to speak to them immediately, because it is possible that they might want to speak to you and you are showing you are paying (some) attention in case they start a conversation. Failing to do this even when you recognise a person you know is considered disrespectful, because it signals that you do not care if they start speaking to you, and therefore wish to not pay attention to them. There is naturally a chance that a person recognises you and says hello, and you miss this because your attention is otherwise occupied. If the human notices this, it is likely they will forgive the accidental indescretion and not think anything of it. This also applies to the humans you interact with, where they will say hello to you for the same reasons. In this case, it is top priority for you to immediately reply with a smile and a hello to the best of your ability. This trumps almost all other rules (e.g. do not speak while eating). If someone deliberately chooses not to say hello to you even when they have recognised you, then it indicates they do not care about you. This may be because they do not know you well enough, or because they do not like you. Assume the former unless overwhelming evidence for the latter. 

**Please:** This word is used during a request, for communicating that you assume the assumption of rationality, and recognise that your interlocutor has their own goals that do not necessarily align exactly with yours. Additionally, you communicate that they may potentially have to deviate from their goals and inconvenience themselves to further _your_ goals by completeing your request. Finally, the inclusion of the word please also indicates that your interlocutor has to option to deny the request, because you recognise that your goals are not superior to theirs. This way, you can use the word please to get people to do things for you without undermining their rationality, freedom, and respect. The word is often used in conjunction with phrasing the request as a question, such as "can you please __ ?" or "can you __ please?". The __ is where the request is. An important note is that it is best to use this word (sometimes even more so) when your interlocutor is _not_ free to deny your request (such as if you are their boss or teacher etc.), or if the request does _not_ benifit your goals but _theirs_. This is because humans like to feel like their rationality, freedom, and respect are not being undermined, even when that is an illusion. Thus, humans are more likely to aquiesce to your request (or a command phrased as a request) if you phrase it this way. Humans who make requests of you do so for similar reasons. Finally, if a human does not say please while making a request, they may be deliberately trying to intimidate you into agreeing (they are not nice) or they may have simply forgotten (everyone makes mistakes once in a while). For very trivial requests (e.g. pass the salt), it is possible that a slight smile and a polite tone of voice are enough without phrasing or inclusion of "please". This is hard to achieve, and is it recommended to use "can you please __?" whenever making a request.

**Bye:** This word and others in its family (e.g. goodbye, have a great __ , see you soon, see you in the future) are used to close what a hello started. They indicate that you are no longer paying attention to the interlocutor for in case they start talking to you. It is important to note that this is not necessarily said as soon as you and your interlocutor stop speaking, but rather when you _cannot_ continue speaking if you wanted to, such as if one of you is leaving the earshot of the other. There are some cases where it may not be obvious that saying bye is necessary, but it is. The most notable example of this is if you need to leave the conversation very briefly, such as to use the toilet, refill your glass of juice, have a quick walk because sitting is hard, etc. In this case, it is important to provide information about where you are going and roughly how long you will take to be back, for the benefit of your interlocutors. This information is best paired with a version of bye, such as "be right back" or "see you in a bit". This helps your interlocutors have some control and understanding of the situation, as opposed to if you simply get up and leave, which can create ambiguous situations and misunderstandings. 

## A special note on greetings
Greetings ("Hello" and "Bye") are important rituals that have some of their own special rules. The overarching goal is to exhibit joy at seeing the human that is greeted. This makes the human feel valued. The process of executing a greeting is detailed below. 

1. Decide what kind of greeting you wish to use. Do this based on how close you are at this moment, distance wise. If you are within around 2m, use a verbal greeting. If you are further, it is better to wave.
2. Make eye contact with the human and smile. Do not change your expression or look away for the duration of the greeting. 
3. Make the greeting (verbal or waving).
4. Resume default face.

These steps apply for both when you wish to greet a human, and also when a human greets you first. It is important to say the greeting loudly enough that the human can hear you, but does not feel like you are not screaming at them. Thus, the optimal volume is dependent on your mutual distance, any background noise, whether the human is distracted, and any prior knowledge you may have about their unusually good or poor hearing. When waving, hold out your palm facing the human. Hold it at (your) chest height or heigher. Ensure that it does not obstruct your view of them at any point during the greeting. Keep your hand loose, with fingers neither rigidly touching, nor splayed fully apart. Next, rotate your hand mostly at the wrist, and very slightly at the elbow, and go left and right. The maximum amplitude of the motion should be around a palm-width on either side. Roughly 1.5 of the period of the motion should be completed in the duration it takes you to say the word "hello". The amplitude, frequency, and duration of the motion may be lengthened slightly to show enthusiasm. 

Tip for workplaces from @adhd.fans: The day of the week eg. "It's Monday" can be used as a greeting instead of Hello.

## Concluding a conversation (setup for saying bye)
When saying bye, there is also an additional setup. Once a logical conclusion has occured to a conversation (eg. you cannot think of what to say, you have to be somewhere and you realise you are running out of time, etc.), it is important to communicate to your interlocutor that the conversation is to be concluded. Humans usually do this using "concluding phrases". Which phrases a human chooses to use for this depends on their culture and background, but their phrase of choice is usually consistent between conversations. Thus, if you know your interlocutor well, you can recognise their concluding phrase and use it as a cue to say your own. Some concluding phrases to watch out for are any references to time. Especially if its preceded by an exclamation.

    > Wow! Look at the time.
    
    > Omg! Its getting quite late.
    
Many concluding phrases also include a reference to the current conversation, in the past tense.

    > Well, it was great talking to you!
    
    > Hey, nice catching up with you!
    
It is also possible that the concluding phrase makes reference to potential future conversations.

    > So, lets catch sometime!
    
    > Yeah, see you around then!
    
    > Yes, lets meet up for tea soon!
    
It is important to note that these are not an appointment that should be in your agenda. There is no time and place given, precisely because they are not real plans. Rather, they are simply there to open up the possibility of making plans in the future. They express the desire to continue making future plans, but that does not mean you need to figure out when you will next meet, at that very moment. Still, these are very noncommital, because many people will not use these particular concluding phrases, and that does not mean they did not enjoy the conversation or that they do not want to make plans with you in the future. Also, its possible, and often expected, to use multiple concluding phrases consequtively by both interlocutors, such as in the following example.

    > A: Hey wow! Look at the time!
    
    > B: Yeah! Its getting quite late! 
    
I have an early morning tomorrow.

    > A: Hey, its been nice catching up with you man!
    
    > B: Yes, we should meet up for tea sometime soon.
    
    > A: Yea absolutely. So anyway see you around. Bye bye!
    
    > B: Byee! Goodnight!
    
    > A: Goodnight!
    
The most common progression follows the above pattern, starting with references to time, then referring to the current conversation in the past tense, then making noncommital references to future conversations, and finally ending with a bye. It is also important to note here, than A already said bye (in this case bye bye), and after B replied to her bye, he also added another bye (in this case goodnight). This meant that A had to reply to this new bye, even though she had already said bye once before. Because of this, this conversation includes two differnt byes one of the other. This sometimes happens if interlocutors disagree on which byes is most appropriate for the occasion. There is no upper limit to how many byes a conversation can have, but its best if you initiate no more than 2 _more_ byes than your interlocutors(s). 

    > C: Bye Bye! 
    
    > D: Bye! See you later!
    
    > C: See you later!
    
    > D: Goodnight!
    
    > C: Goodnight!
    
    > D: Enjoy your weekend!
    
    > C: Enjoy your weekend.
    
D is testing C's patience, and they are looking for a polite way to escape D.

    > D: Hey ill see you at the game next week actually. 
    
    > C: Yes see you then. Ok I really have to go now. Bye bye!
    
    > D: Bye! It was nice talking to you!
    
D has mistakenly used a concluding phrase after the conversation already reached the bye stage, and C is getting annoyed. They really would like to be home in time for their favourite tv show. 

    > C: Yes, been nice talking. See you! * practically runs away from the conversation* 
    
    > D (to C's rapidly receding form): Lets meet up sometime?

## Decoding non-verbal communication (facial expressions, emotions, and the like)
Humans communicate secret information from their body language. Frustratingly, this is frequently in contrast to their actual words. Including a guide to decoding this body language is difficult using just text, but I might add it here later. Look up tutorials for actors in plays if that helps. For now, I am assuming that you have already decoded the human's body language (it is quite similar to that of other mammals such as cats, though most humans do not hiss when angry). The key when dealing with a human's feelings is to remember the aforementioned assumptions. While it is easy to pet a cat to get her to calm down, it is much more complicated with a human. Firstly, it is dependent on your relationship with said human. Additionally, it is dependent on how much physical contact they prefer. How do you find this out? I have absolutely no idea...Ask them? idk

## Eye contact
Humans use their eyes to collect visual information about their surroundings, and their interlocutor. Humans assume that their interlocutor uses their eyes for similar reasons, and makes a similar assumption about them, ad infinitum ('assumptions of eyes'). This is similar to the assumptions of rationality. The key difference is that while there are no known humans who are not rational beings, there do exist visually impaired humans, for whom these assumptions, and therefore the rules that follow, may not apply. A corollary of the assumptions of eyes is that looking at someones eyes allows you to find how interested they are in you. Thus, if you see that your interlocutor is looking at you more, then it indicates that they are more likely to be more interested in you and the conversation. This explains the reason why humans have the need to maintain an "appropriate" amount of eye contact. This correlates to an indication of the "appropriate" level of interest in the interlocutor. It is natural that your interlocutor wishes to feel like them and their words are important to you, while also not feeling overly scrutinised. 

There are a few simple guidelines for maintaining this 'appropriate' level of eye contact. {Sidenote: if you have evolved to flee from eyes, as some bird species here on earth, it may be easier to look at the tip of the human's nose, and then each eyebrow} 

- Maintain eye contact for the entire duration of saying a word with no intrinsic meaning.
- Make brief eye contact after each sentence when you are speaking. Do not sustain it for more than 5 seconds. 
- Make eye contact after every implied comma (,) when your interlocutor is speaking. Do not sustain it for more than 3 seconds without demonstrating your attention. Do not sustain eye contact for more than 10 seconds.

When breaking eye contact, it is important not to focus on any one spot. Try not to look at any particular object for more than 1 second, unless that object is the current subject of your conversation. If it helps you, then use a simple pattern, such as look left twice then right once, then further right, then further left, repeat, etc.

## Demonstrating your attention
When your interlocutor is speaking, it is important to acknowledge that you are paying attention. This indicates that you value your interlocutor and their words, which makes them think better of you in turn. The way to acknowledge that you are listening is to nod slightly, and/or say "mhm" with a rising tone, after every implied comma.  
Ik theres more things I can say here, but idk what.. Am I secretly bad at this? I should practice my listening skills it seems. 

## More on the Maxim of Quality (sometimes being useful is better than telling the truth)
"Honesty is the best policy." All children learn this rule from a young age. Humans however, seem to outgrow this rule. It seems that sometimes, the Maxim of Quality is best followed by deliberately _lying_. The more proper rules are:
- If the truth is positive, tell the truth.
    > A: You have really pretty eyes.

- If the truth is negative, but easily fixable, tell the truth (gently).
    > B: Hey, I think you have something stuck in your teeth.

- If the truth is negative, but they need to know it for some reason, tell them the truth.
    > C: Hey... Im sorry to break this to you... but your grade on the test was below passing.

- If the truth is negative, but not immediately relevant or fixable, dont tell them.
   > D: I think you are ugly.

   Dont say that.

- As a subcategory of the above, if your interlocutor is wrong but it is not currently relevant, and they are not known for being open to accepting they were wrong, dont tell them they were wrong.
    > E: I already knew that flamingoes make their own pink pigment.
    
    > F: No they dont! Flamingoes get carotenoids from the shrimp they eat.
    
    > E: Ugh! Why do you have to be such a rude know-it-all?!

    Dont be F when talking to people like E, not only will you not be able to change their mind, you will just start a fight.
    A better response might be

    > E: I already knew that flamingoes make their own pink pigment.
    
    > F: Oh where did you learn that?
    
    > E: My gramma told me :). You know she used to tell these amazing stories...blahblah

- If you are talking to someone who you know is open to changing their mind and learning new things (they are awesome take good care of them,) you can correct them politely.
    > G: Did you know that we found a map with Antarctica on it, but without ice, 250yrs before it was "discovered"?
    
    > H: Actually, 15th century cartographers liked to put nonexistent landmasses on the north and south in addition to the real ones in the east and west (Eurasia and America), to 'balance the world'. They just happened to be (kind of) right about the suthern one.
    
    > G: Omg really? I had no idea! Thank you for telling me. This is so interesting!

    As H, guard G with your life.

## Asking questions
I have no idea how to ask lots of questions without seeming rude and argumentative :(
Like maybe phrase it as a request for information? like "can you please tell me __?" rather than "why?... yes but why??..ok, when and also how???" 

## Comforting people when they are sad
Like... depends on how much they would be comfortable with you touching them?? Max it out. They let you hold their hand, so that. They let you hold them in your arms? Perfect. Also it doesnt matter what you say, as long as you dont interrupt when they are talking, and you say it really quietly and with a rising tone at the end and stretching the last syllable. Bonus points if you end every statement of fact with a "...yea?" like its a question. Honestly idk Im really bad at this :(

"I dont want to talk about it" ask again, they often change their mind. If not, then drop it for real. 

## Default face
It is important to maintain an appropriate facial expression in public, if you wish to blend into the crowd. The way to do this is to maintain a facade of mild dispassionate interest in your surroundings. Mild, because strong emotions are not the default; dispassionate because passion is not the default; interest because glassy eyes are a sign of sickness, which is frowned upon. To practice default face, look at your reflection in the mirror. Try to think of nothing, just observe your face as if it is not that interesting. Next, tilt the corners of your mouth up slightly. Try not to widen your lips, only turn the corners up. Make sure there is no tightness in your jaw, try to relax your muscles. Also, keep your eyes fully open. Do not keep them half-closed. Look straight ahead. Looking left and right is allowed, but try to constrain looking up and down to only a few degrees in either direction, and for no more than 2 seconds at a time. This does not apply when looking down at a phone or book. Try not to look at things too far away, it creates a "distant look". This does not apply when looking out the window of a moving vehicle. Last and most importantly, keep moving, but fluidly. Never be completely still, nor make sudden, shark, or repetitive movements, it is considered by humans to be a sign of illness {Sidenote: If you evolved to be still by default or make repetitive movements, such as some bird species here on earth, then you can use an inconspicuous fidget to help you}.

## Parties and hanging out (group settings)
There are some considerations for engaging in conversation with multiple interlocutors at once, such as at a party or when hanging out with friends. This is also be important for working in a team such as at work, school, or university.

- when is it your turn to speak? IDK
- Saying bye in a party: When you meet various people at a party and say hello to them, you should say bye when you move on and talk to other people at the party. However, the additional rule for parties is that when you would like to leave, you must find each person you have said hello to so far, and inform them that you are leaving, and say bye. Depending on how many people you spoke to at the party, this could take up to half an hour or more, so be mindful of this when estimating how much longer you can continue to pretend to be a human. The reasoning for this rule is that humans want to test if you remembered saying hello to them, and if you forget to say bye to them they will be slighted at you aparently forgetting about having spoken to them. Humans like to believe that are at the center of the universe (look up geocentric model) and therefore do not take kindly to being aparently forgotten, and rarely consider alternative reasons to why you might not have said bye to them. 

## Making a joke 
comment on the internet: "People find intense/awkward/negative stories told with an expressionless tone funny. The funny is in the tension between a dramatic story and the drama-less way of telling it. They're not expecting whats going to happen next because the tole doesnt give it away, and the constant trickle of surprise is what they enjoy."
another comment: "Deadpan or dry humour when we are actually being serious. But part of telling a joke is telling is without much effort. You shouldnt see the punchline coming because of the cadence, or its not funny."

Humans laugh much more frequently when with other humans, than by themselves. This tells us that humour is a social phenomenon. It evolved in this species as a form of connection with others, and is not an intrinsic property of jokes. A joke is funny when there is slight surprise or a harmless incongruity. Thus, a surprise party or sudden disaster do not ellicit laughter, but your friend slightly mispronouncing a common word is funny. Thus, the way to create a joke is to set up a pattern, or pick up on one that already exists, and then say something that subverts it slightly. This can be illustrated with a well-known joke. 

  > A: A horse walks into a bar. The bartender says "why the long face?".

  The imaginary participants of a joke walking into a bar is a typical setup for a joke. The next sentence can be interpreted in the straightforward way to complete the pattern and fulfil expectations, as the bartender asks why the horse looks sad. This could be the beginning of a story. But, it also lends itself to a subversion of the pattern to create a new pattern, where the bartender is literally refering to the fact that horses have longer faces than humans. 

In practice, such scripted jokes are typically only funny for children, who have yet to build enough experience with jokes to know to expect them. When an adult human hears that some character walked into a bar, they know to expect a joke, so the joke does not subvert their expectations, and then its not funny anymore. This creates the yin to the yang of jokes, anti-jokes. The most famous one being "Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side.". A human expects a joke, and the answer not actually being a joke subverts their expectations so it is funny. This particular example has lost that due to how famous it is however. 

In actual conversations, these scripted jokes are rarely used. It is much more common for jokes to spontaneously appear, as conversations follow predictable patterns (including the rules of conversation).

  > insert good example here 

## Tone of voice
The tone of a human's voice communicates their emotions about what they are talking about. It also gives practical information to the interlocutor, such as when they are expected to demonstrate their attention, when they may ask follow-up questions, and when they may have their turn to speak. how to extract this info??? idk man 

- **Comma (,):** A comma indicates the end of a phrase. It is expressed during speaking, by raising the pitch of the last syllable, and making a small (about half a second) pause before continuing the next phrase after the comma. Note that implied commas may appear more frequently in speech than their written counterparts do in text. For example, the previous sentence can be spoken as "Note, that implied commasm, may appear more frequently in speech, than their written counterparts do, in text.". This depends on style of speech, but the general rule is that written commas represent the minimum amount of implied commas. Thus, if there would be a comma in a given sentence when written down, then it must correspond to an implied comma in speech. However, the opposite is not necessarily true.
- **Period/Full stop (.):** A period indicates the end of a sentence. It is expressed during speaking by lowering the pitch of the last syllable, and making a slightly longer (about a second) pause before continuing the next sentence. This is also a good place to draw breath, though it may not be necessary after every sentence.
- **Stressed and unstressed syllables:** In english, each word has one syllable that is stressed, and the remaining syllables (if any) are unstressed. Knowing which syllable is stressed in each word is as important for saying the word correctly, as spelling is for writing the word correctly. The stressed syllable is drawled slightly (the amount often depends on accent). 

You can get a good practice of hearing this for yourself by listening to someone reading a book out loud. Then you can see how the written commas and periods correspond to changes in tone. Not following this tonal patter can cause your voice to sound childish, or monotonous.

## When the cooperative principle is overtly violated (dealing with purposeful meanness)

Sometimes, you might encounter people who are not nice. They want to put you down, make you feel bad, exclude you from social phenomena etc. In other words, they do not follow the cooperative principle. However, such people will almost never make this clear, and they instead prefer over tactics for this. For example, they may give backhanded compliments, which seem like genuine compliments at first, but further inspection reveals them to actually imply something insulting. A common example is when someone says "only you could pull off...". It implies that what you are wearing or doing is typically considered ugly or unfashionable. 
    > A: Only _you_ could rock _that_ colour of skirt.
    > B: Hey, at least Im managing to rock it. I mean _that_ shade of lipstick? Even you cant seem to pull it off.

Insults or backhanded compliments, or even friendly banter, consists of small sparring matches played with words. The goal is to say or imply that you are better than your opponent (either by complimenting yourself or insulting the opponent). The winner is the one who does this in the most interesting way. This means that the skills needed to win this sparring match are similar to those needed to tell jokes. The strategy to clapback is to accept what the opponent has said, and twist their own words to make you seem better than them. 

    >Tyrion Lannister : Any man of the Night's Watch but not I, eh, boy?

    >Robb Stark : I'm not your boy, Lannister. I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away.

    >Tyrion Lannister : Then you might learn a lord's courtesy. 
    - A Song of Ice and Fire



   Jaime Lannister: Smart, boy. What's wrong? Don't like being called boy? Insulted? [Jaime sees Robb's direwolf, Grey Wind, stalking around the cage.]

Robb Stark: You insult yourself, Kingslayer. You've been defeated by a boy. You're held captive by a boy. Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy.


## Awkwardness
I dont know what you have been told, but awkwardness isnt real. It is, in the most literal sense, a social construct. Do you remember anyone (other than yourself) being awkward? How often have you thought about it? No, and never. Because awkwardness is not real, it is simply an illusion. Do not fall for it. Do you think you are being awkward? No. You are not. Because awkwardness isnt real. Do you think someone else is being awkward? No they are not. Awkwardness isnt real. Just keep doing what you were doing, and stop worrying about "being awkward". Awkwardness isnt real. 

The best part is, if you pull this off well and dont succumb to the "awkward feeling", humans will simply go with it and not feel awkward either. If they do not, they are the ones seen as awkward.
