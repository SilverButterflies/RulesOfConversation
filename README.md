Are you a robot trying to understand its creators? Are you an alien trying to study humans? Then you have come to the right place. Here you will find the rules of conversation that govern (most) human communication. A word of warning however, if you are here to find out how to _pretend_ to be human? Turn back now for that way lies disaster. Live among the humans, connect with them, learn from them, but do not pretend to be them. And with that, I shall introduce you to Grice and his Cooperative Principle.

Grice writes in his book Logic and Conversation (1975) of the Cooperative Principle, "Make your contribution such as is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged". 

Fair enough, but this is too vague to be useful on its own, so we will get into the details. Grice introduced the concept of "conversational implicatures". Essentially, the act of saying something does not only communicate the meaning of each word. The manner in which a person has chosen to say something, the time and place, the person they are talking to, etc. also communicate information. Even the fact that a person chose to say anything at all (as opposed to _not_ saying a thing) communicates information to the listener (called the interlocutor), and anyone else observing the exchange. The reason that this 'secret information' is communicated is that there are some assumptions shared by the interlocutors about each other. The most basic of these are listed below.
1. Your interlocutor is a rational thinking being, just like you. This means that they choose to talk (or choose not to) in a particular way because they have some goal in mind.
2. Your interlocutor assumes the same about you, ad infinitum.

So now the question is, what is this goal? Interlocutors may share a goal, such as transferring information from one interlocutor to another, or even to simply make pleasant conversation. It is possible that the interlocutors do not share a goal, such as in a debate. An interlocutor may communicate their goals, or they may choose to hide them (almost always for malicious reasons). Before we consider how you can communicate your goal to the interlocutor as well as understanding theirs, we will get back to Grice's Cooperative Principle.

The cooperative principle essentially states that unless there is very obvious evidence to the contrary, humans assume that they are cooperating with their interlocutor to achieve a shared goal. In service of this goal, there are four "maxims" that are known (usually implicitly) by all humans. Now it is easy to assume that these maxims are unbreakable rules that must always be followed. However, this is incorrect, as humans violate these maxims all the time. And because all humans know these maxims, and they assume their interlocutor knows these maxims, this can be used to communicate secret information. 

The four maxims are:
1. Quantity: Say only how much you need to say, not more not less.
2. Quality: Be truthful.
3. Relation: Connect your thought to the thought that came before.
4. Manner: Speak in a way that you will be understood by your interlocutor.

Looking at this list, they look like universal rules if you want to be understood. In fact, if you, dear reader, vow to never violate a maxim to the best of your ability, you will likely still be understood by your interlocutor, though they may think you speak funny. However, you cannot control the fact that humans violate these maxims in oftentimes confusing ways, so you must keep a look out for them. 
There are four ways to violate a maxim:
1. Quietly: This is known as 'lying by omission'.
2. Opt-out: your interlocutor might apologise for not being allowed to say more eg. "sorry, my lips are sealed"
3. Clash: There is no way to fulfill one maxim without violating another. For example if your interlocutor does not know something, they cannot fulfil the maxim of Quantity without violating the maxim of Quality.
4. Flouting: The interlocutor blatantly violates a maxim for no aparent reason.

The last case seems bizarre to the uninitiated. The reasoning is that if the interlocutor is violating a maxim but not making any effort to hide it, then they must want you to see it, by the assumption that they are a rational being. Then, as they are assumed to know you are a rational being too, you can infer _why_ they are violating said maxim, without them having to _tell_ you explicitly. Thus, flouting a maxim can be used to communicate secret information between interlocutors.

Each maxim has many sub-maxims, and each sub-maxim can be violated in many ways. To see excellent examples of each, it is best to read Logic and Conversation by H.P. Grice. However, when you are walking among the humans, it is much more useful to learn how to apply the above information to tap into the secret information. 

## Words that have no intrinsic meaning
What does "Hello" mean? It is not a noun or a verb or an adjective, and yet pretty much every language has a word for it. It is the same with "Bye", "Please", "Thank you", and many others. These words are special because they can _only_ communicate secret information. Furthermore, as many of us are not aware of this secret information, it is a frequent mistake to simply stop using them.
